# CarbonKit - SvelteKit with Carbon Design

This is a template project for creating SvelteKit application with IBM Carbon Design System implementation.

> This is a work in progress
> INSERT/DELETE on Companies and Contacts in real time
> Next is UPDATE with details page for both companies and contacts

> Just started to implement Supabase https://supabase.io/ to get/send data with CarbonKit

## Clone project

```bash

git clone git@github.com:myangga/carbonkit.git

```

## Install dependencies

```bash

npm install

```

## Run application

```bash

npm run dev -- --open

```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
